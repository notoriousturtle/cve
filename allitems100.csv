CVE-1999-0001,Candidate,"ip_input.c in BSD-derived TCP/IP implementations allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or hang) via crafted packets.","CERT:CA-98-13-tcp-denial-of-service   |   BUGTRAQ:19981223 Re: CERT Advisory CA-98.13 - TCP/IP Denial of Service   |   CONFIRM:http://www.openbsd.org/errata23.html#tcpfix   |   OSVDB:5707   |   URL:http://www.osvdb.org/5707",Modified (20051217),"   MODIFY(1) Frech  |     NOOP(2) Northcutt, Wall  |     REVIEWING(1) Christey"," Christey> A Bugtraq posting indicates that the bug has to do with  |     ""short packets with certain options set,"" so the description  |     should be modified accordingly.  |       |     But is this the same as CVE-1999-0052?  That one is related  |     to nestea (CVE-1999-0257) and probably the one described in  |     BUGTRAQ:19981023 nestea v2 against freebsd 3.0-Release  |     The patch for nestea is in ip_input.c around line 750.  |     The patches for CVE-1999-0001 are in lines 388&446.  So,   |     CVE-1999-0001 is different from CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052.  |     The FreeBSD patch for CVE-1999-0052 is in line 750.  |     So, CVE-1999-0257 and CVE-1999-0052 may be the same, though  |     CVE-1999-0052 should be RECAST since this bug affects Linux  |     and other OSes besides FreeBSD.  |   Frech> XF:teardrop(338)  |     This assignment was based solely on references to the CERT advisory.  |   Christey> The description for BID:190, which links to CVE-1999-0052 (a  |     FreeBSD advisory), notes that the patches provided by FreeBSD in  |     CERT:CA-1998-13 suggest a connection between CVE-1999-0001 and  |     CVE-1999-0052.  CERT:CA-1998-13 is too vague to be sure without  |     further analysis."
